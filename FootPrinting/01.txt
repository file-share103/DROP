Lesson 01: Introduction to Footprinting
Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
Understand the concept and importance of footprinting in ethical hacking.
Differentiate between passive and active footprinting.
Identify various footprinting techniques and tools.
Perform basic footprinting tasks ethically.
Recognize legal and ethical boundaries in information gathering.

1. What is Footprinting?
 
●	Definition:
o	Footprinting is the process of gathering information about a target system or network to identify potential vulnerabilities.
●	Objective:
o	To collect data for further penetration testing or vulnerability analysis.
●	Analogy:
o	Similar to gathering blueprints before breaking into a building.

2. Why is Footprinting Important?
●	Preparation for Attacks:
o	Attackers gather as much information as possible before attempting to exploit a system.
●	Benefits for Ethical Hackers:
o	Helps in identifying system configurations, network architectures, and security measures.
●	Business Context:
o	Understanding the security posture and minimizing potential risks.

3. Types of Footprinting
 
3.1 Passive Footprinting:
●	Definition:
o	Gathering information without directly interacting with the target.
●	Techniques:
o	Social media profiling
o	WHOIS and DNS lookups
o	Publicly available data
●	Tools:
o	Google Dorking
o	Maltego
●	Demo:
o	Using Google Dorks to find exposed files:
o	site:example.com filetype:pdf
3.2 Active Footprinting:
●	Definition:
o	Directly interacting with the target to gather information.
●	Techniques:
o	Port scanning
o	Ping sweeps
o	Traceroute
●	Tools:
o	Nmap
o	Netcat
●	Demo:
o	Scanning open ports on a target using Nmap:
o	nmap -sS -p 1-1000 target.com

4. Footprinting Techniques
 
4.1 Network Footprinting:
●	Purpose:
o	Discovering the network architecture and topology.
●	Methods:
o	IP address range discovery
o	Subdomain enumeration
4.2 DNS Footprinting:
●	Purpose:
o	Extracting DNS information to map the domain’s structure.
●	Methods:
o	Zone transfers
o	Reverse DNS lookup
4.3 Website Footprinting:
●	Purpose:
o	Collecting information from the target website.
●	Methods:
o	Analyzing meta tags
o	Extracting comments from HTML source

5. Using OSINT for Footprinting
●	What is OSINT?
o	Open Source Intelligence: Gathering publicly available data from online sources.
●	Sources:
o	Social media platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter)
o	Public databases (Shodan, Censys)
o	News articles and public reports

6. Hands-On Activity:

Activity 1: Perform passive footprinting using Google Dorking to find open directories.
Activity 2: Use Nmap to scan for open ports on a local network.
Activity 3: Enumerate DNS records for a domain using the nslookup tool.
Activity 4: Extract metadata from images using ExifTool.
Activity 5: Use Shodan to find exposed IoT devices.

7. Real-World Scenarios
●	Case Study 1:
o	How an attacker used WHOIS data to launch a phishing attack.
●	Case Study 2:
o	Passive footprinting leading to the discovery of unsecured databases.
●	Case Study 3:
o	Combining OSINT data for targeted social engineering.

9. Practical Challenges and Limitations
●	Accuracy Issues:
o	Public data might be outdated or incorrect.
●	Detection Risk:
o	Active footprinting might trigger security alerts.
●	Data Overload:
o	Managing and analyzing large volumes of gathered data.
●	Anti-Footprinting Measures:
o	Use of firewalls and intrusion detection systems to block reconnaissance.

10. Summary & Key Takeaways

Footprinting is a critical first step in ethical hacking.
Understanding passive and active techniques is essential for gathering comprehensive data.
OSINT plays a significant role in modern footprinting.
Always maintain ethical standards and acquire proper authorization.
Being aware of the risks and limitations ensures responsible and effective information gathering.

Lesson 02: Tools for Footprinting (WHOIS, Wappalyzer, Wayback Machine)
 
Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
●	Understand what footprinting tools do.

●	Use simple tools to gather information about websites.

●	Know the pros and cons of each tool.

●	Use the info to help with security testing (ethically!).

1. What Are Footprinting Tools?
Footprinting tools help you gather information about a website, system, or network — before doing any deeper security checks.
Why Use Them?
●	Saves time — no need to dig manually.

●	Gets useful data fast and safely.

●	Can be passive (quiet) or active (more direct).


1.1 WHOIS Lookup
 
What It Does:
Tells you who owns a domain and when it was registered.
How to Use:
whois example.com

Or go to sites like:
 🌐 whois.domaintools.com
What You Get:
●	Domain owner (if not hidden)

●	When the domain was created

●	Expiry date

●	Registrar info

Good For:
●	Finding out who owns a suspicious or target website.

●	Checking if a domain is legit.

Limitation:
●	Info may be hidden by privacy protection.

1.2 Wappalyzer
 
What It Does:
Shows what technology a website is built with.
How to Use:
●	Install the Wappalyzer browser extension (Chrome/Firefox).

●	Visit any site, click the icon.

What You See:
●	CMS (like WordPress)

●	Server type (Apache, Nginx)

●	JavaScript libraries

●	Analytics tools

●	E-commerce platforms

Good For:
●	Seeing if a site uses outdated or risky software.

●	Learning what tools competitors use.

Limitation:
●	Doesn’t always catch everything, especially if hidden.

1.3 Wayback Machine
 
What It Does:
Lets you see old versions of websites.
How to Use:
Go to:
 🌐 archive.org/web
 Type a URL and choose a past date.
What You See:
●	Older content

●	Deleted pages

●	Previous site designs

●	Exposed info that may now be hidden

Good For:
●	Finding removed or sensitive data

●	Checking changes in content or branding

Limitation:
●	Not every site or page is saved

●	Some content (like JavaScript) may not load properly

2. Hands-On Practice
Try these simple activities:
1.	Use WHOIS to look up your school or a known domain.

2.	Use Wappalyzer to check the tech behind your favorite website.

3.	Look up an old version of a website using the Wayback Machine.

3. Be Ethical!
●	Ask First: Don’t scan or test websites you don’t own or have permission to check.

●	Stay Legal: Breaking rules can lead to trouble — even jail time.

●	Be Respectful: Never use info to harm others or invade privacy.

4. Key Takeaways
●	WHOIS = Info about who owns a domain.

●	Wappalyzer = See what tech a site uses.

●	Wayback Machine = View old versions of a site.

●	These tools are safe and passive — great for starting your recon.

●	Use them responsibly and legally.
